# InnoDino: Modular Robotics for All

## Overview
InnoDino is an open-source, low-cost modular robotics learning platform designed to make hands-on coding and robotics accessible to every learner—especially those in under-resourced schools and communities. The project features:

- **Ultra-affordable hardware kits** (LED Matrix & Robot) at a price point not available anywhere else in the market
- **Modular design**: Start with one kit, expand with more modules as you grow
- **Visual block-based programming** via a mobile app (no PC required)
- **Offline-first**: All coding and uploading works without internet
- **Story-driven learning**: Each module is a playful, progressive adventure
- **Open-source and extensible**: Designed for educators, makers, and students to remix and expand

## Why InnoDino?
- **No other kit offers this combination of price, modularity, and offline mobile programming.**
- Designed for real-world constraints: works in rural, low-connectivity, and low-income settings
- Empowers independent, creative exploration—not just classroom demos

## Modules
- **LED Matrix Module**: Learn coding basics, logic, and animation with an Arduino Nano-powered 8x8 LED grid
- **DinoBot Module**: Program a simple robot to move, sense, and avoid obstacles
- **Future Expansion**: Music, sensors, home automation, and more—all with the same controller

## How It Works
1. **Assemble your kit** (LED or Robot)
2. **Download the InnoDino mobile app** (Android/iOS)
3. **Create programs using drag-and-drop blocks**
4. **Upload code to your kit via USB/serial cable**
5. **See your code come to life—no internet or PC needed!**

## Who Is It For?
- K-12 students, teachers, and parents
- Rural schools, after-school programs, and community centers
- Anyone who wants to learn robotics and coding affordably

## Get Involved
- All hardware designs, code, and curriculum are open-source
- Contributions, translations, and new module ideas are welcome!

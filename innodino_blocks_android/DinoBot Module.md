### 🟡 Mission 2: "Dance of the Dino Spirits" (Rotational Movement)

**🎭 Story:** Zara encounters the ancient Dino Spirits who perform the sacred "Four Winds Dance." To earn their blessing, Zara must learn the art of **Turning Magic** - mastering left and right rotations to join the mystical ceremony!

**📚 Coding Quest:** Make the robot turn left and right. Practice directional control.

**🎯 Goal:** Learn rotational movement to change direction efficiently.

**⚔️ Motion Spells Unlocked:**
- `Turn Left`: Rotate counterclockwise to face new paths  
- `Turn Right`: Rotate clockwise to explore different directions
- `Move Forward/Backward`: Combine with turns for complex navigation

**🏆 Victory Condition:** Create the "Four Winds Dance" - perform a complete square pattern using forward movements and turns!

### 🔵 Mission 3: "Echoes of the Ancient Sensors" (Sensor-Based Navigation)

**🎭 Story:** Deep in the Digital Ruins, Zara discovers the legendary Ultrasonic Crystal - an ancient artifact that can see through shadows! The Guardian Spirits challenge Zara: "Only those who can sense their surroundings may navigate safely through the maze ahead."

**📚 Coding Quest:** Use the ultrasonic sensor to read distance and print the result. Learn environment sensing.

**🎯 Goal:** Learn to perceive the environment using sensor magic.

**⚔️ Sensing Spells Unlocked:**
- `Read Distance`: Measure distance to nearby obstacles using echo magic (in cm)
- `Print`: Display sensor readings to understand the digital environment
- `If / Else`: Make navigation decisions based on sensor input
- `Comparison (<, >, =)`: Compare distances to navigate safely

**🏆 Victory Condition:** Create a "Digital Scout" program that reads and displays distance measurements to understand surroundings!

### 🟣 Mission 4: "Guardian's Simple Test" (Basic Obstacle Detection)

**🎭 Story:** The Crystal Guardian presents Zara with her first real test: "Young explorer, show me you can stop when danger approaches!" Zara must prove she can sense obstacles and react appropriately by stopping when something blocks her path.

**📚 Coding Quest:** Move forward and stop when an obstacle is detected within 10 cm.

**🎯 Goal:** Learn basic obstacle avoidance through simple stop behavior.

**⚔️ Advanced Spells Unlocked:**
- `While/Until Loop`: Continue moving until a condition is met
- `Variable (Set/Get)`: Store distance readings for decision making
- `Logic Operation (AND/OR)`: Combine multiple sensor conditions

**🏆 Victory Condition:** Create a "Safety First Explorer" that moves forward but immediately stops when detecting obstacles within 10 cm!

### 🟢 FINALE: "Master of the Autonomous Realm" (Advanced Navigation)

**🎭 Epic Story Conclusion:** Zara stands before the Grand Crystal Portal, the ultimate test of Digital Valley! The Ancient AI speaks: "To restore balance to our realm, you must become truly autonomous - move forward with purpose, but navigate around obstacles you encounter. Show mastery over both motion and perception!"

**📚 Final Coding Challenge:** Move forward continuously unless an obstacle is detected, then navigate around it.

**🎯 Ultimate Goal:** Create truly autonomous navigation that combines movement with intelligent obstacle avoidance.

**⚔️ Master Navigation Spells Combined:**
- `Read Distance`: Continuously scan the environment ahead
- `Move Forward`: Maintain forward progress toward the goal
- `Turn Left/Right`: Navigate around detected obstacles  
- `While/Until Loop`: Create continuous autonomous behavior
- `If/Else`: Make real-time navigation decisions
- `Variables`: Track movement state and distance readings

**🏆 Epic Victory:** Create the "Autonomous Valley Explorer" - a program that moves Zara forward continuously but intelligently navigates around obstacles, demonstrating true robotic autonomy!

**🎊 Celebration:** Zara becomes the legendary **Master Navigator**, and the Digital Valley celebrates as she unlocks the secrets of autonomous exploration forever!

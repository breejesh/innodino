## üéì Educational Content Structure

### Curriculum Design Philosophy
The educational content follows a **story-driven, mission-based learning approach** that transforms abstract programming concepts into engaging adventures:

#### LED Module - "Rex's Crystal Magic Adventure"
- **5 Progressive Missions** from basic LED control to complex sensor-responsive light shows
- **Programming Concepts:** Variables, loops, conditionals, sensor input, LED matrix control
- **Narrative Framework:** Rex the Robot Dino explores Digital Dinosaur Valley

#### DinoBot Module - "Zara's Navigation Quest"
- **5 Progressive Missions** from basic movement to autonomous navigation
- **Programming Concepts:** Movement control, sensor-based decisions, obstacle avoidance
- **Narrative Framework:** Zara the DinoBot saves the Digital Valley

### Learning Progression
1. **Mission 1:** Basic control (LED on/off, forward/backward movement)
2. **Mission 2:** Advanced control (variables/turning)
3. **Mission 3:** Sensor integration (distance-based decisions)
4. **Mission 4:** Simple automation (patterns/basic obstacle detection)
5. **Mission 5:** Complex autonomous behavior (light shows/navigation)
